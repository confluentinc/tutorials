In the case of this tutorial, we're interested in capturing data that reflects incoming orders as well as details on unique discount codes. Kafka Connect can easily stream in data from a database containing that information; you can use the following template as a guide to setting up a connector.
Through a series of ksqlDB statements, we'll enrich our order data and compute some simple statistics based on that stream of enriched order data. By the end, we'll have more insights as to just how well our discount code promotion is doing. Specifically, we'll know the average order value per discount percentage as well as the average number of items purchased.
