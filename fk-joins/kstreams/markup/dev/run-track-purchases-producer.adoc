Run the following in a new terminal window. This process is the most fun if you can see this and the previous terminal (which is consuming the music interest results) at the same time. If your terminal program lets you do horizontal split panes, try it that way:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/fk-joins/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer-track-purchases.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the producer starts up, copy and paste these lines into the terminal. Then you can observe the results in the consumer terminal:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/fk-joins/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/track-purchases.json %}</code></pre>
+++++

Please note that do to the nature of how a `KTable` works,  you won't see results simultaneously.  You need to wait roughly 30 seconds or so after pasting the lines above to see any results in the consumer terminal.

Speaking of that consumer terminal, these are the results you should see there if you paste in all the albums and track-purchases as shown in this tutorial:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/fk-joins/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/outputs/music-interest.json %}</code></pre>
+++++

You have now joined a table to a table with a foreign key! Well done.
