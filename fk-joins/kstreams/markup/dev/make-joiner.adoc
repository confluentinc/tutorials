For the ValueJoiner class, create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/MusicInterestJoiner.java`.

When you join two tables in a relational database, by default, you get a new table containing all of the columns of the left table plus all of the columns of the right table.
In Kafka Streams, when you join two tables, you still get a new table, but you must be explicit about which value(s) are included from both tables.

The `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/ValueJoiner.html[ValueJoiner]` interface in the Streams API does this work. The single `apply()` method takes the "left" table and the "right" table values as parameters, and returns the value of the joined table as output. (Their keys are not a part of the equation, because they are equal by definition and do not change in the result.) As you can see here, this is just a matter of creating a `MusicInterest` object and populating it with the relevant fields of the input album and track purchase.

You can do this in a Java Lambda in the call to the `join()` method where you're building the stream topology, but the joining logic may become complex, and breaking it off into its own trivially testable class is a good move.
