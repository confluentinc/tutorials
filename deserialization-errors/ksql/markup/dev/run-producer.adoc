Before we move foward with the implementation, we need to produce records to the `SENSORS_RAW` topic, that as explained earlier, is the underlying topic behind the `SENSORS` stream.
Let's use the console producer to create some records.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the console producer starts, it will log some messages and hang, waiting for your input.
Type in one line at a time and press enter to send it.
Each line represents an sensor with the required data.
Note that for testing purposes, we are providing two records with data in the right format (notably the first two records) and one record with an error.
The record with the error contains the field `ENABLED` specified as string instead of a boolean.
To send all sensors below, paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input-events.json %}</code></pre>
