# How to compute the difference between two columns with ksqlDB

Suppose you have a topic with events that represent a customer's purchase history, where each event also includes the 
amount of the customer's previous purchase. In this tutorial, we will use ksqlDB to calculate the difference between the
current and previous purchase amounts.

## Setup

Assume a stream named `customer_purchases` in which each event contains the amounts of the customer's current and 
previous purchases:

```sql
CREATE STREAM customer_purchases (
        id VARCHAR,
        current_purchase DOUBLE,
        previous_purchase DOUBLE,
        txn_ts VARCHAR,
        first_name VARCHAR,
        last_name  VARCHAR)
    WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='customer_purchases',
          VALUE_FORMAT='JSON',
          PARTITIONS=1);
```

## Calculate the difference between two columns

Now create a query to determine the difference between two columns:

```sql
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
       current_purchase - previous_purchase as purchase_diff
FROM customer_purchases
EMIT CHANGES;
```

## Running the example

You can run the example backing this tutorial in one of two ways: locally with the `ksql` CLI against Kafka and ksqlDB running in Docker, or with Confluent Cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Local With Docker</summary>

  ### Prerequisites

  * Docker running via [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Ensure that the command `docker compose version` succeeds.

  ### Run the commands

  Clone the `confluentinc/tutorials` GitHub repository (if you haven't already) and navigate to the `tutorials` directory:

  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:confluentinc/tutorials.git
  cd tutorials
  ```

  Start ksqlDB and Kafka:

  ```shell
  docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose-ksqldb.yml up -d
  ```

  Next, open the ksqlDB CLI:

  ```shell
  docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server:8088
  ```

  Run the following SQL statements to create the `customer_purchases` stream backed by Kafka running in Docker and populate it with
  test data.

  ```sql
  CREATE STREAM customer_purchases (
          current_purchase DOUBLE,
          previous_purchase DOUBLE,
          txn_ts VARCHAR,
          first_name VARCHAR,
          last_name  VARCHAR)
      WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='customer-purchases',
            VALUE_FORMAT='JSON',
            PARTITIONS=1);
  ```

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO customer_purchases (current_purchase, previous_purchase, txn_ts, first_name, last_name)
      VALUES (50.89, 28.99, '2024-08-04 02:35:43', 'Tony', 'Stark');
  INSERT INTO customer_purchases (current_purchase, previous_purchase, txn_ts, first_name, last_name)
      VALUES (23.12, 12.99, '2024-08-04 02:35:44', 'Nick', 'Fury');
  INSERT INTO customer_purchases (current_purchase, previous_purchase, txn_ts, first_name, last_name)
      VALUES (20.00, 6.99, '2024-08-04 02:35:45', 'Natasha', 'Romanov');
  INSERT INTO customer_purchases (current_purchase, previous_purchase, txn_ts, first_name, last_name)
      VALUES (99.29, 1.99, '2024-08-04 02:35:46', 'Wanda', 'Maximoff');
  ```

  Finally, run the column difference query. Note that we first tell ksqlDB to consume from the beginning of the stream.

  ```sql
  SET 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';

  SELECT first_name,
         last_name,
         current_purchase - previous_purchase as purchase_diff
  FROM customer_purchases
  EMIT CHANGES;
  ```

  The query output should look like this:

  ```plaintext
  +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  |FIRST_NAME         |LAST_NAME          |PURCHASE_DIFF      |
  +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  |Tony               |Stark              |21.90              |
  |Nick               |Fury               |10.13              |
  |Natasha            |Romanov            |13.01              |
  |Wanda              |Maximoff           |97.30              |
  +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  ```

  When you are finished, exit the ksqlDB CLI by entering `CTRL-D` and clean up the containers used for this tutorial by running:

  ```shell
  docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose-ksqldb.yml down
  ```

<details>
  <summary>Confluent Cloud</summary>

  ### Prerequisites

  * A [Confluent Cloud](https://confluent.cloud/signup) account
  * The [Confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/install.html) installed on your machine

  ### Create Confluent Cloud resources

  Login to your Confluent Cloud account:

  ```shell
  confluent login --prompt --save
  ```

  Install a CLI plugin that will streamline the creation of resources in Confluent Cloud:

  ```shell
  confluent plugin install confluent-cloud_kickstart
  ```

  Run the following command to create a Confluent Cloud environment and Kafka cluster. This will create 
  resources in AWS region `us-west-2` by default, but you may override these choices by passing the `--cloud` argument with
  a value of `aws`, `gcp`, or `azure`, and the `--region` argument that is one of the cloud provider's supported regions,
  which you can list by running `confluent kafka region list --cloud <CLOUD PROVIDER>`
  
  ```shell
  confluent cloud-kickstart --name ksqldb-tutorial \
    --environment-name ksqldb-tutorial \
    --output-format stdout
  ```

  Now, create a ksqlDB cluster by first getting your user ID of the form `u-123456` when you run this command:

  ```shell
  confluent iam user list
  ```

  And then create a ksqlDB cluster called `ksqldb-tutorial` with access linked to your user account:

  ```shell
  confluent ksql cluster create ksqldb-tutorial \
    --credential-identity <USER ID>
  ```

  ### Run the commands

  Login to the [Confluent Cloud Console](https://confluent.cloud/). Select `Environments` in the lefthand navigation,
  and then click the `ksqldb-tutorial` environment tile. Click the `ksqldb-tutorial` Kafka cluster tile, and then
  select `ksqlDB` in the lefthand navigation.

  The cluster may take a few minutes to be provisioned. Once its status is `Up`, click the cluster name and scroll down to the editor.

  In the query properties section at the bottom, change the value for `auto.offset.reset` to `Earliest` so that ksqlDB 
  will consume from the beginning of the stream we create.

  Enter the following statements in the editor and click `Run query`. This creates the `customer_purchases` stream and
  populates it with test data.

  ```sql
  CREATE STREAM customer_purchases (
          current_purchase DOUBLE,
          previous_purchase DOUBLE,
          txn_ts VARCHAR,
          first_name VARCHAR,
          last_name  VARCHAR)
      WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='customer-purchases',
            VALUE_FORMAT='JSON',
            PARTITIONS=1);

  INSERT INTO customer_purchases (current_purchase, previous_purchase, txn_ts, first_name, last_name)
      VALUES (50.89, 28.99, '2024-08-04 02:35:43', 'Tony', 'Stark');
  INSERT INTO customer_purchases (current_purchase, previous_purchase, txn_ts, first_name, last_name)
      VALUES (23.12, 12.99, '2024-08-04 02:35:44', 'Nick', 'Fury');
  INSERT INTO customer_purchases (current_purchase, previous_purchase, txn_ts, first_name, last_name)
      VALUES (20.00, 6.99, '2024-08-04 02:35:45', 'Natasha', 'Romanov');
  INSERT INTO customer_purchases (current_purchase, previous_purchase, txn_ts, first_name, last_name)
      VALUES (99.29, 1.99, '2024-08-04 02:35:46', 'Wanda', 'Maximoff');
  ```

  Now paste the query to calculate the column difference in the editor and click `Run query`:

  ```sql
  SET 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';

  SELECT first_name,
         last_name,
         current_purchase - previous_purchase as purchase_diff
  FROM customer_purchases
  EMIT CHANGES;
  ```

  The query output should look like this:

  ```plaintext
  +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  |FIRST_NAME         |LAST_NAME          |PURCHASE_DIFF      |
  +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  |Tony               |Stark              |21.90              |
  |Nick               |Fury               |10.13              |
  |Natasha            |Romanov            |13.01              |
  |Wanda              |Maximoff           |97.30              |
  +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  ```

  ### Clean up

  When you are finished, delete the `ksqldb-tutorial` environment by first getting the environment ID of the form 
  `env-123456` corresponding to it:

  ```shell
  confluent environment list
  ```

  Delete the environment, including all resources created for this tutorial:

  ```shell
  confluent environment delete <ENVIRONMENT ID>
  ```
