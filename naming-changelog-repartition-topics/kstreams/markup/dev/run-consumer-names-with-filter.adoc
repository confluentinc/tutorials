  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

////

Finally, start a console-consumer.


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You should see the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output-names-with-filter.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

The last three records, `2-4, 2-5, 2-6`, show the correct output, as you produced six records with the same key.

You have updated your topology and reused the existing state stores and internal topics!

. Always name stateful operators
. If you haven't named your stateful operators and you need to update your topology, use the `https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/app-reset-tool.html[Application Reset Tool]` to reprocess records.

- **Aggregation repartition topics (if needed)**
   . Use the `Grouped.as()` method
   . Use `Grouped` to provide repartition `Serdes` as well if required
   . Kafka Streams appends the text `-repartition` to the provided name
   . If no name is provided, the state store name is used with `-repartition` appended

- **Joins**
   . Use the `StreamJoined` configuration object
   . `StreamJoined.name()` names the join processors and provides the base-name of the repartition topic (if needed)
   . `StreamJoined.withStoreName()` is used to name the state stores associated with the join.
   . If you need to provide `Serdes` you'll use `StreamJoined` as well

- **State Stores**
   . Use `Materialized.as()` method
   . Use `Materialized` for state store `Serdes` if needed
