Run a performance test to capture a baseline measurement for your Kafka producer, using default configuration parameters.
This test will send 10000 records of size 8000 bytes each.

Your results will vary depending on your connectivity and bandwidth to the Kafka cluster.

```
10000 records sent, 134.560525 records/sec (1.03 MB/sec), 25175.34 ms avg latency, 44637.00 ms max latency, 26171 ms 50th, 39656 ms 95th, 42469 ms 99th, 44377 ms 99.9th.
```

The key result to note is in the last line: the throughput being `134.560525 records/sec (1.03 MB/sec)`.
This is the baseline producer performance with default values.
