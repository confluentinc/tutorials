Here are some producer configuration parameters you can set to increase throughput. The values shown below are for demonstration purposes, and you will need to further tune these for your environment.

* `batch.size`: increase to 100000–200000 (default 16384)
* `linger.ms`: increase to 10–100 (default 0)
* `compression.type=lz4` (default `none`, i.e., no compression)
* `acks=1` (default `all`, since Apache Kafka version 3.0)
